Following code is deprecated and any missing logic should be migrated to other places:

lib/to_be_migrated/brpm_framework.rb
lib/to_be_migrated/customer_include_default.rb
lib/to_be_migrated/resource_framework.rb
lib/to_be_migrated/local_jirb.rb - contains env specific logic
transport/* - decide where these functionalities should end up (preferrably in BRPM itself)

[brpm_module_brpm]/lib/brpm_rest_client.rb and [brpm_module_brpm]/lib/brpm_rest.rb - should be merged
