Following code is deprecated and any missing logic should be migrated to other places:

modules/framework/brpm_framework.rb
modules/framework/customer_include_default.rb
modules/framework/lib/resource_framework.rb
modules/framework/tests/local_jirb.rb - contains env specific logic
modules/framework/transport/* - decide where these functionalities should end up (preferrably in BRPM itself)
modules/brpm/lib/brpm_rest_client.rb and modules/brpm/lib/brpm_rest.rb - should be merged
